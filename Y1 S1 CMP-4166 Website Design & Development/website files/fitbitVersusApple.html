					For this review, we will only be comparing the latest version of Fitbit smartwatches/trackers and Apple Watches. Although Google Pixel Watch is made by Fitbit, it is also made by Google therefore we won't be counting it on this comparison - sorry Google Pixel Watch lovers. People who get into fitness tend to use some method of tracking their progress, be it an app on their smartphone a personal trainer or good ol’ pen and paper (but this is a bit redundant in this day and age). Both Fitbit and Apple provide great alternatives to these methods in their smartwatch devices but the question is which one is better?

				First, let's talk money, currently Fitbit is selling its Fitbit Versa 3 for the price of £169.99 and it's the lowest-priced smartwatch on their site meanwhile the highest-priced smartwatch is the Fitbit Sense 2 selling for £219.99. Additionally, Fitbit offers trackers for as little as £49.99, these are more focused on providing fitness-related information rather than being a smartphone-like device where you can send messages from or browse the web. As for Apple, the lowest-priced smartwatch is the Apple Watch SE selling for £219 meanwhile the Apple Watch Hermès goes for a whopping £1,229. By the price alone there is a huge difference, making the Fitbits more budget-friendly compared to Apple Watches.

			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
		</div>

		<div class="styledParagraph">
			<p>
				Overall the better choice for a fitness smartwatch would be the Fitbit smartwatches, as they are more affordable compared to the Apple watches, the Fitbit smartwatches are compatible with both Android and Apple smartphones - compared to the Apple watch that can only connect to Apple smartphones. The Fitbit watches and trackers are more fitness-oriented as the devices contain multiple methods of helping the user with their fitness through built-in software and hardware, whereas the Apple Watch is more of a phone replacement - this isn't to say that the Apple Watch doesn't provide the user with any way of tracking their fitness, as Apple does provide its user with a workout app to track and monitor activity.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, if you mostly have Apple devices and you want all your data to be in one place without having the hassle of making new accounts for a new device then purchasing an Apple Watch might be your go-to. Not only can the Apple Watch act as a phone but it is also an extremely stylish watch. Apple has kept style as one of its main focuses when it comes to developing Apple Watches. As the current fashion trends change over the years, Apple has been keeping up with the changes and has been implementing ways of making Apple Watches personalised, some of these changes include, allowing users to change the watch straps, including more colour variants when purchasing the device and giving the user ways of changing the theme of the screen itself.
